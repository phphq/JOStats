FAQ:

  - A. No, the Multi-Tracker will only work with the latest versions available.

  - Q. Does the JOStats work with any of the mods/expansions?
  - A. Full support has been added for the Escalation expansion, Reality mod and 
        International Conflict mod.

  - Q. Is there plans to support other CMS's?
  - A. There is a posibilty of an Xoops version in the near future, but other 
        CMS's will depend on demand.

  - Q. I have an idea that sounds cool for the Tracker/PHP Scripts, will you listen to my idea and 
        possibly implement it?
  - A. Were always open to hearing new suggestions on making our programs better. If you have an idea, 
        post about it in the forums. If it's not a huge amount of work to implement and theres a reasonable 
        amount of people that like your idea, then yes we will implement it.

  - Q. No matter what i try, i just can't seem to get it to work, what do i do?
  - A. Head on over http://www.babstats.com and post in the support forums.
        When posting if you follow these simple guidelines when posting we will be able to help
        you alot faster:
       
        - Post wether it's a PHP script problem or a Tracker Problem (if you know).
        - If it's a PHP script problem, post you PHP and MYSQL versions.
        - Be descriptive as possible about the error and post what error number or message was giving 
          if any and also what you were doing at the time the error occurred.

  - Q. Would you install the PHP scripts on my website for me?
  - A. If requested too we can, but this will mean you will have to give us your ftp login details to your site and
        admin login details if it's a CMS site, if your comfortable with this then we will happily install the 
        scripts for you.
